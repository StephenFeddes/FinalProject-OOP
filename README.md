## Description:
This is the final project I chose to design on my own as a final project for my Object-Oriented Programming class.
The OOP concepts my project used are: abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance. I also used three design patterns: delegation, model-view-controller, and factory.
Other things this project highlights are user-interfaces, multithreading, event-handling, exception handling, getters and setters, interfaces, inner classes, and anonymous inner classes.

To run the program, go to the file "ChessGameDriver.java" and run the main method. Make sure the ChessPieces folder, ChessLib.java file, ChessModel.java, ChessController.java, ChessView.java, and ChessGameDriver.java are all located in the same folder.
